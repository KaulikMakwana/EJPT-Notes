### **Types of Information Gathering:** 

1) *Passive Information Gathering:*
	-> gather information by `without actively engaging` with the target.
	- ip address & dns info
	- domain names , social profiles
	- subdomains, web technology, google dorks
	- search engines (shodan, cencys,netcraft,dnsdumpster,other similar..)

2) *Active Information Gathering:*
	-> gather information by `actively engaging with the target`system.
	- port scanning, service/ os fingerprinting 
	- host discovery/ network mapping
	- internal infrastructure
	- enumeration
