# ðŸ§  Security Auditing vs Penetration Testing

| Aspect | Audit | Pen Test |
|--------|-------|----------|
| Purpose | Evaluate controls & compliance | Simulate attacks to exploit flaws |
| Scope | Broad (policies, physical, etc.) | Focused (specific systems/apps) |
| Method | Interviews, documentation, checks | Real-world attack techniques |
| Output | Compliance gaps, policy issues | Vulnerabilities, exploits |
| Frequency | Regular (annually/biannually) | On demand / change-driven |

### âœ… Typical Sequence:
1. **Perform Security Audit**
2. **Use findings to plan Pen Test**
