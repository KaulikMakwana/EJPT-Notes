### üî∏ What Are Web Applications?

- **Web apps** are software programs accessible through browsers over the internet.
    
- Enable users to perform tasks like:
    
    - üì¨ Email (Gmail, Outlook)
        
    - üõí E-commerce (Amazon)
        
    - üì± Social Media (Facebook, Twitter)
        
    - üìä Cloud tools (Google Workspace)

### üß± Web Application Architecture

- **Client-Server Model**:
    
    - **Client**: Browser (UI/UX interaction)
        
    - **Server**: Hosts app logic, processes requests
        
- **Components**:
    
    - HTML, CSS, JS (Client-side)
        
    - PHP, Python, Java (Server-side)
        
    - Databases: MySQL, PostgreSQL
        
    - Web Servers: Apache, Nginx

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Threat vs Risk

- **Threat**: A potential cause of an unwanted incident, which may result in harm to a system or organization.
    
    - Example: A hacker trying SQL injection.
        
- **Risk**: The probability that a threat will exploit a vulnerability and the impact it could have.
    
    - Example: If the web app has poor input validation, there's a high risk of successful SQLi.

### üîê Web App Security Practices

Web Application Security Practices are defensive measures implemented to protect web apps against threats and vulnerabilities. These practices ensure **confidentiality, integrity, and availability** of data.

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Practice|Definition|Purpose|
|**Authentication & Authorization**|Authentication verifies user identity; Authorization checks if they have permission.|Prevent unauthorized access|
|**Input Validation**|Ensures that user input is safe and expected.|Prevents attacks like SQLi, XSS|
|**Secure Coding Practices**|Writing code with security in mind from the start.|Reduces coding-related vulnerabilities|
|**HTTPS (TLS/SSL)**|Encrypts data between browser and server.|Prevents eavesdropping and data theft|
|**Patching Regularly**|Keeping software and dependencies up to date.|Fixes known vulnerabilities|
|**Least Privilege Principle**|Assign only the permissions necessary.|Minimizes impact of a compromised account|
|**Session Management**|Securely handles user sessions and tokens.|Prevents session hijacking|
|**Web Application Firewall (WAF)**|Filters and monitors HTTP traffic.|Blocks common attacks automatically|

### üîç Security Testing vs Pentesting

|Category|Web App Security Testing|Web App Pentesting|
|---|---|---|
|Objective|Find vulnerabilities|Exploit & test detection|
|Scope|Broad (tools + manual)|Focused, manual-heavy|
|Exploitation|No|Yes (authorized)|
|Impact|Non-intrusive|Might cause downtime|
|Reporting|Recommendations|Exploit evidence + fixes|

## üìù HTTP Protocol Fundamentals

### üåê HTTP Overview

- **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)**: Stateless, application layer protocol.
    
- Runs on top of TCP (usually port 80).
    
- Two main versions: **HTTP/1.0** and **HTTP/1.1**.
    
- Follows **client-server architecture**:
    
    - Browser = Client
        
    - Web server = Server
        

### ‚ÜîÔ∏è HTTP Message Exchange

- **Request**: Sent by client
    
- **Response**: Sent by server
    

---

### üì¢ HTTP Request Components

**1. Request Line**

- Format: `METHOD URL HTTP/VERSION`
    
- Example: `GET /index.html HTTP/1.1`
    

**2. Headers** (Key:Value pairs)

- `Host`, `User-Agent`, `Accept`, `Authorization`, `Cookie`
    

**3. Body** (Optional)

- Used with POST/PUT to send data (form or JSON)
    

---

### üìã Common HTTP Methods

|Method|Function|
|---|---|
|GET|Request a resource without modifying it|
|POST|Send data to the server (e.g., form)|
|PUT|Update or create a resource|
|DELETE|Remove a resource|
|PATCH|Partial update|
|HEAD|Like GET but no body, just headers|
|OPTIONS|What methods the server supports|

---

### üì∞ Example HTTP Request

```http
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: www.google.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1)
Accept: text/html
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: keep-alive
```

---

## üëå HTTP Responses

**Response Components**:

1. **Status Line** ‚Äî Protocol + Status Code + Message
    
    - Example: `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`
        
2. **Headers**
    
    - `Content-Type`, `Cache-Control`, `Set-Cookie`, `Content-Encoding`
        
3. **Body** (optional) ‚Äî The actual content
    

### üî¢ HTTP Status Codes

|Code|Meaning|
|---|---|
|200|OK|
|301|Moved Permanently|
|302|Found (temporary redirect)|
|400|Bad Request|
|401|Unauthorized|
|403|Forbidden|
|404|Not Found|
|500|Internal Server Error|

---

### ü§¥ HTTPS (Secure HTTP)

- **HTTPS = HTTP + SSL/TLS encryption**
    
- Encrypts data in transit (confidentiality, integrity)
    
- Uses port **443** by default
    
- **Does NOT protect** against web app attacks (e.g., XSS, SQLi)
    

---

### üîÑ Data Interchange Protocols

- **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)**: Lightweight, easy to read/write, commonly used in web APIs.
    
- **XML (Extensible Markup Language)**: Structured data format, used in SOAP and legacy systems.
    
- **REST (Representational State Transfer)**:
    
    - Uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
        
    - Most modern APIs are RESTful
        
- **SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)**:
    
    - Uses XML for communication
        
    - More rigid, with strict rules (used in enterprise systems)
        

---

### ü§ù Summary of Key Takeaways

- HTTP is essential for all web communication
    
- Understanding headers, methods, and responses is critical for security testing
    
- Use tools like **Burp Suite**, **Postman**, or **curl** to inspect HTTP traffic
    
- HTTPS encrypts traffic but doesn‚Äôt fix insecure web code
