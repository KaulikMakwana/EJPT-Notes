In cybersecurity, a threat vector refers to the method or means by which a cyber threat or attack is introduced to a target system or network. It represents the path or avenue that threat actors use to exploit vulnerabilities and compromise the security of an organization's information technology infrastructure. Understanding threat vectors is crucial for developing effective cybersecurity strategies and defenses.

Here are some common threat vectors:

**Emails and Phishing**: Threat actors often use phishing emails to trick users into revealing sensitive information or clicking on malicious links. Email attachments containing malware are another common threat vector.

**Malicious Websites**: Visiting compromised or malicious websites can expose users to various types of attacks, including drive-by downloads and the exploitation of browser vulnerabilities.

**Social Engineering**: Human manipulation techniques, such as pretexting, baiting, or impersonation, are employed to trick individuals into divulging confidential information or performing actions that compromise security.

**Malware**: Malicious software, including viruses, trojans, ransomware, and spyware, can be delivered through various means, such as infected files, websites, or removable media.

**Exploiting Software Vulnerabilities**: Threat actors target known vulnerabilities in software applications, operating systems, or network services to gain unauthorized access or execute malicious code.

**Supply Chain Attacks**: Attackers compromise the supply chain by injecting malicious code or compromising hardware or software components before they reach the end user.

**Insider Threats**: Individuals within an organization with access to sensitive information may intentionally or unintentionally pose a threat to security.

**IoT Devices and Smart Technologies**: Insecure Internet of Things (IoT) devices and smart technologies can serve as entry points for cyber attacks, especially if they lack proper security controls.
