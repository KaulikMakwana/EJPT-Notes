# common types of application attacks:

**Path Traversal (Directory Traversal)**: This attack involves exploiting insufficient security controls to access files or directories that are outside the intended directory structure.

**Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** In XSS attacks, attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages that are then executed by a user's browser. This can be used to steal session cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or deface websites.

**SQL Injection (SQLi):** Attackers use SQL injection to manipulate a web application's database by injecting malicious SQL queries into user inputs. This can lead to unauthorized access, data manipulation, or data exfiltration.

**Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**: CSRF attacks involve tricking a user's browser into making an unintentional and unauthorized request to a web application on which the user is authenticated. This can lead to actions being performed on behalf of the user without their consent.

**Security Misconfigurations**: Improperly configured security settings in web applications can expose sensitive information, such as database credentials, or provide unauthorized access to certain functionalities.

**Command Injection**: Attackers exploit vulnerabilities that allow them to execute arbitrary commands on a web server. This can lead to unauthorized access, data manipulation, or disruption of services.

**File Upload Attacks**: If a web application allows users to upload files, attackers may attempt to upload malicious files, such as scripts or malware, to compromise the server or execute arbitrary code.

**Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)**: Attackers exploit flaws in the authentication and authorization process to access or manipulate objects (files, database records) they are not supposed to have access to.

**XML External Entity (XXE) Attacks**: Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the processing of XML input to extract sensitive information from the server or conduct denial-of-service attacks.

Protecting against application attacks requires a multi-layered approach, including secure coding practices, regular security testing (such as penetration testing and code reviews), implementing proper access controls, and employing web application firewalls (WAFs) to filter and monitor HTTP traffic. Regular updates and patches are also essential to address known vulnerabilities.
